  Hello! My name is Nick. I've spent the past 8 years in San Francisco after growing up in the greater DC area. 
  I currently split my time between the Bay Area and the Bahamas with my fiance, Alice. I spend as much time outdoors as possible.
  Most of my free time is spent traveling, skiing, free diving, working out, swimming, exploring music, and spending quality time with friends.
</p>

<p> 
  Of course, my other passions are coding, data and automation. I love telling stories with data and building tools that make work easy.
  I have a strong background in data science, analytics, and engineering. Lately, I've been working on my full-stack dev skills, so I built this website!
  I graduated from William & Mary with a BS in Applied Math (Statistics) & Economics, as well an MS in Business Analytics from their Mason School of Business.
</p>

<p>
  Professionally, I've built a career working in data, primarily in the FinTech space.
  I spent the past 3 years at Stripe on Cost Platform Technical Operations team, where I built interchange decision trees in Ruby, scheme fee models with SQL, and an internal tool with Spark, Python and Streamlit. 
  Prior, I spent close to 4 years at Marqeta on their Data Science/Analytics team, working on Finacial products and operations automations.
  My first year out of grad school was with comScore, where I built and managed webpage analytics dashboards for a couple Fortune 500 clients using SQL Server, Bash, and Excel.
